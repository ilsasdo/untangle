# ðŸ§¶ untangle

Find usage of classes, packages in legacy and messy projects.

So you've inherited a bunch of java libraries widely used across your organization.
Of course there is little to no documentation, you don't know how and where your libraries are used.
But you need to make modifications and refactors and you *know* that something will get broken.

With **untangle** you can inspect all the jars and classes to find the usage of your libraries to check what you can or can't change.
